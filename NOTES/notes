Why You Doing Dis?

I want to make sure I can write safe code. I used to think that I could just whip up a buncha components and third-party libraries in a pot and serve it. Not. Good. Not a good way to think at all. I looked over my code before for my other web projects and they were all disorganized, not pretty, and i think one especially had a lot of vulnerabilities. You know which one. the fitness webapp one. ugh makes me cringe. anyways lets start this one, the RIGHT way.

oh but another note is the original chatApp didnt have good security rules. the firebase rules were set in a very uhm. it was stupid TwT it was literally just checking if the user is authenticated LMAO

Chat app

SECURITY DETAILS:

for privChats

-   isFriend

-   notBlocked

-   notBanned

for groupChats:

-   inGroup

-   notBlocked

-   notBanned

FOR BACKEND FIREBASE:

-   write only to themselves

-   no data regarding banning should be implemented within their own writable data... obviously.

SCHEMA:

-   privateMessages

-- DM1 (dmID, users - SHOULD ONLY BE 2 MAX - set a rule or smthign for this)

--- msgID, sender, content (file, text, file and text), timestamp
--- ...

-- ...

-   groupMessages

-- GC1 (gcID, users)

--- msgID, sender, content (file, text, file and text), timestamp
--- ...

-- ...

Additional Security Things:

Configure CORS (cross origin resource sharing probably also in firebase i dunno maybe u wanna use a different framework or smthing for hosting, we'll see)

RUN ZAP SPIDER ON THE SITE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY VULNS YOU MISSED

MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO IDORS

Firebase Authentication uses JWT tokens

{Object.keys(usrData).map((key, index) => (

<div key={index}>
{usrData[key] !== undefined && (
<p>
{key}
{usrData[key]}
</p>
)}
</div>
))}

mapping a object in tsx
